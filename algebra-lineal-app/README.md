# Algebra Lineal App

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing vector and matrix calculations using linear algebra. It leverages the `AlgebraLineal` class to perform various mathematical operations and visualize results in 2D and 3D.

## Features

- Vector operations: addition, scalar product, vector product, and more.
- Matrix operations: inversion, determinant calculation, and solving linear systems.
- Visualization of vectors and matrices in 2D and 3D.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction with mathematical functions.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd algebra-lineal-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/ui.py
   ```

2. Use the GUI to input vectors and matrices for various operations. The interface provides buttons for executing calculations and options for visualizing results.

## Example Operations

- **Vector Addition**: Input two vectors and click the "Add" button to see the result.
- **Matrix Inversion**: Input a matrix and click the "Invert" button to get its inverse.
- **Graphing**: Select vectors to visualize them in 2D or 3D space.
